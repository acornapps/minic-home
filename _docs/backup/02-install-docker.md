## Install Docker

Minic requires Docker to run the Cocktail mini container. Install Docker, depending on your host operating system. Refer to following link.

[Docker install](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

In macOS and Windows, Docker is launched on virtual machine that is hosted on your PC
or notebook. So, all containers(including Cocktail mini container) only use resources that the virtual machine has.
Because of this reason, you should configure the Dockerâ€™s advanced options of resources for running Minic.
